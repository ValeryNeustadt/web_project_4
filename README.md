**Media Queries**  

There are three layouts that can be used on mobile devices, tablet devices and desktop computers. The web page is responsive, i.e. the width of the content area changes depending on the width of the browser window without any horizontal scrolling.

The popup with profile part opened once the user clicks on the "Edit" button, and closes upon clicking on the close button in the upper right corner. As soon as the form is opened, the "Name" and "About Me" fields are filled in with the values displayed on the page. If the user closes the pop-up window by clicking the close button, the entered values will not be saved. As soon as the user enters new information and clicks on the "Save" button, the page is updated to reflect the changes made, while the pop-up window closes at the same time. 

Form for Adding a Card. This form opens once the user clicks on the "+" button, and closes when the user clicks on the "Close" button. User can write a custom name for the card and add a link to a picture. Once the user clicks on the "Save" button, the new card appears in the beginning of the cards container. 

"Like" button for the cards: If the user clicks on the "Like" button, the heart changes its color. 

There is a "Trash" button on the images. If the user clicks on it, the image under the button is deleted. 

Once the user clicks on a picture, the pop up with that picture opens. When user clicks "Close," it  closes.

The pop up windows  opens and closes smoothly. When opened, all pop up windows smoothly appear out from transparency, and when closed, they smoothly become completely transparent again.
